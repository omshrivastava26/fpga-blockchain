# fpga-blockchain  

The purpose of this project is to implement a Key-Value store on FPGA
using Cuckoo Hashing. A Key-Value pair(KVP) is a fundamental data representation of two associated data items: a key and a value, where the key acts as
a unique identifier for the values. After KVPs are inserted into the system, they
can searched or deleted with the corresponding key only. We have used Cuckoo
hashing to implement the system using Verilog as our programming language to
program the FPGA.   

### Assignment-1
  
This assignment was done with the goal to get familiar with the Verilog HDL. One bit comparator, one bit adder, eight bit comparator and eight bit adder were
implemented.  

### Assignment-2
  
This assignment involved the implementation of Cuckoo hashing using Verilog, and its testing using a testbench.
Cuckoo Hashing is a form of open addressing in which each non-empty cell of
a hash table contains a key-value pair.A hash function is used to determine
location for each key and its presence in the table can be determined by examining the cell of that table.It is a technique for resolving collisions in hash tables
that produces a dictionary with constant-time worst-case lookup and deletion
operations as well as amortized constant-time insertion operations.
  
  
### Assignment-3
  
Assignment 3 involved implementation of UART transmitter and reciever modules. These modules were tested using a testbench. UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter, which is a
computer hardware for asynchronous serial communication in which the transmission speeds are configurable. It is based on serial data transfer, which involves bit by bit transfer of the data bits, from the least significant bit to
the most significant bit. UART is an asynchronous communication protocol,
viz. There is no clock synchronisation between the receiving and transmitting
UARTs. Thus both the receiving and transmitting systems must agree on a predecided but configurable frequency, called the â€˜Baud rateâ€™.The UART makes use
of Start bit and Stop bit to handle the timing of data transmission.  

Transmitter Module:
This module receives the data in the form of an 8 bit array and the start, stop
and parity bit and then transfers it to the receiver module.  

Receiver Module:
This module receives the data from the Transmitter module, samples the data
to only store the middle of every tick and then remove the start, stop and parity
bits and the transfers the data bus to the receiving end.

### FPGA-Keyvalue Assignment

This is the final assignment of the project where we actually connect all the dots and actually implement the main aim of our project.  

Block RAMs (or BRAMs) stands for Block Random Access Memory. Block
RAMs are used for storing large amounts of data inside of the FPGA. We have used BRAM to store all the tables corresponding to the key-value database.
We have used Single Port Block
RAM configuration to read data from .txt files and store them in arrays. These .txt files are used to initialise the key-value database.
The .txt files used are:   

- value_valueadd.txt: This file contains the values to the corresponding
value addresses.  

- hashtable1_key.txt: This file relates a particular key to a particular
index which is the output of the first hash function when the said key is
its input. We initialized some indices with their corresponding key values
and the rest are initialized to 0.  

- hashtable1_valadd.txt: This file contains the value addresses of corresponding keys in hashtable1 key.txt.  

- hashtable2_key.txt: This file relates a particular key to a particular
index which is the output of the second hash function when the said key is
its input. We initialized some indices with their corresponding key values
and the rest are initialized to 0.  

- hashtable2_valadd.txt: This file contains the value addresses of corresponding keys in hashtable2 key.txt.
  
  
NOTE: Since 0 is used to indicate that a given index is not initialised, 0 cannot
be used as a key. Similarly, the value address 0 is not alloted to any value, as it
is used to indicate an uninitialised index in the key to value address mapping
tables.  

Then these arrays are used for the main Key Value Store/Database operations : INSERT, SEARCH
and TRANSACT:  
- INSERT: This operation is used to insert a key-value pair (using analogy of a bank account,
the key can be thought of the account number and the value is the money present
in the account) into the hash tables, using Cuckoo Hashing algorithm.  

- SEARCH: We use this operation to search for a particular key and then display the corresponding value against the key. Again, we use Cuckoo Hashing algorithm to
implement the search which reduces the time complexity to O(1)(worst case).
The Key goes through the Hashing functions which gives us 2 possible indices
where the key might be stored at. We then check both these locations for the
Key. If it is present in either the locations then we return the value corresponding to the key.  

The file create_bram.v contains code for the search and transact operations on the block ram entries.
It has been tested using the test bench file - create_bram_tb.v

Update: The create_bram.v file now contains working code for insert operation on block ram.
It has been tested using the create_bram_tb.v - testbench file.

Some conditions:
No key can have value 0
Value stored must be non zero for any key

1. The incoming packet must have the format:

for refer:
command-code 1 byte
key 4 bytes
trailing zero 1 byte (00000000) used for detection purposes.

for transfer:
command-code 1 byte
key-debit 4 bytes
key-credit 4 bytes
transfer amnt
trailing zero 1 byte

for issue:
command-code 1 byte
key 4 bytes
amnt 4 bytes
trailing zero 1 byte

for create:
command-code
key
initial balance
trailing zero


IGNORE this important note below. No restrictions, it works.

Important note:

While sending multiple commands, the different commands must be such that previous command's zero byte must coincide with the reset signal.
i.e. as each byte requires #freq time for transmission along the communication channel, in this period only the reset must be done.
Such that the NEGEDGE of reset corresponds to the beginning of the next command.

command 1 ... zero byte--> 00000000

                       negedge reset
                                   |
                                   |
